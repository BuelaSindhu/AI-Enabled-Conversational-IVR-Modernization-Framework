# Agile Documentation  
AI-Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

---

## 📌 1. Project Vision
To modernize traditional IVR systems by integrating AI-powered conversational capabilities such as STT, TTS, NLP, and intelligent intent-based routing, creating a faster, smarter, and more natural customer experience.

---

## 📌 2. Agile Methodology
This project follows the **Agile Scrum** model with:
- 2-week sprints  
- Daily stand-ups  
- Frequent testing and reviews  
- Continuous improvement  

---

## 📌 3. Sprint Details

### **Sprint 1 – Requirement & Architecture Setup**
**Deliverables:**
- Requirement gathering  
- High-level architecture  
- Basic IVR flow design  
- GitHub repository setup  

**User Stories:**
- US01: As a user, I want to speak instead of pressing buttons.  
- US02: As a developer, I want an initial IVR flow mapped.  

---

### **Sprint 2 – AI/NLP Engine Development**
**Deliverables:**
- Speech-to-Text integration  
- NLP model for intent detection  
- Initial conversational flow  

**User Stories:**
- US03: As a customer, I want the IVR to understand my spoken requests.  
- US04: As a system, I must detect and classify user intent correctly.  

---

### **Sprint 3 – IVR Flow Automation & Backend Integration**
**Deliverables:**
- Dynamic IVR routing  
- Call summary generator  
- API development  
- Error fallback logic  

**User Stories:**
- US05: As a system, I should automatically route calls based on intent.  
- US06: As an agent, I want a summary of each conversation.  

---

### **Sprint 4 – Testing & Deployment**
**Deliverables:**
- Unit testing  
- Integration testing  
- Load and performance testing  
- Final deployment  

**User Stories:**
- US07: As a QA engineer, I must test each NLP and IVR module.  
- US08: As a product owner, I want a stable production-ready system.
